# BranchlockDesktop
Desktop application for the Branchlock obfuscator, with configurations and annotation ex/inclusions.

# Prerequisites
- Branchlock Full Licence - I have in no way tested this for Branchlock demo and I am going to assume it does not work.
- Chrome, Edge, or Firefox installed - This makes use of Selenium which means you must have one of these installed on your OS. Selenium runs a browser environment in the background.

# Note
- This is not done, at all, come back later if you want to use it
